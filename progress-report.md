# AARON reverse-engineering progress

Updated 2026-10-13. This is the compact project snapshot; technical evidence
and the running investigation history are linked below.

| Measure | Current status | What it means |
|---|---:|---|
| Distinct Lisp function binding names inventoried | 1,347 | Includes accessors and UI/host routines; it is not a count of recovered algorithms. |
| Routines with bounded JS/original comparisons | 30 names / 31 contracts | These are limited, measured behavior slices, not 30 complete function reconstructions. |
| FREE-PATH matrix rows compared to JS | 26/30 directly comparable match; 4 mismatch; 10 unclassified | 40 captured cases total; eight use index settings the API cannot express, and two source `-0.0d0` values were captured as `+0.0`. |
| Execution-plan milestones fully achieved | 1/5 (20% by milestone count) | Four are not yet fully achieved. Milestones are unequal in size, so this is not a project or time estimate. |
| Whole-painting parity | 0 complete results | No full painting has passed an original-versus-JS equivalence check. |

**There is no defensible overall completion percentage yet.** Function names
are not an implementation denominator, and the project has no weighted
function-by-function coverage or whole-scene scoring system. The measured
20% applies only to milestone count. The 26/30 FREE-PATH match rate applies
only to that finite canonical test subset.

The JavaScript engine is a useful partial implementation and research harness,
but it is not yet a general reproduction of AARON. The main remaining work is
to recover upstream random and drawing decisions, finish and connect the
freehand/brush/fill/colour/clipping/output path, recover composition and object
generation, and verify complete paintings against fresh original runs.

## Current focus

FREE-PATH now has 40 source-bound direct cases. Its current JS API matches 26
of 30 cases with canonical list indexes; four seed-1234 polygon cases still
differ, while eight noncanonical-index cases and two signed-zero cases remain
unclassified. The exact native payloads are mapped, but the natural caller
capture is not complete: one 320×480 before control finished, then its observer
was stopped by the D: staging-space gate. No caller hit or after control was
captured. The triplet driver now reserves disk for all three runs before it
starts and rechecks before each launch. The next step is to rerun the bracket
when the staging volume has the documented headroom, then pursue a new
discriminator for the remaining stop-rule mismatches.
