## AARON

AARON was a screen saver released in [2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20010516025702/http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/) for Windows. It can generate paintings (with people, plants, a painting in background etc) in screensaver. It was pulled from website but can still be [downloaded from wayback machine](https://archive.org/details/kurzweilcyberart_aaron). It still works on windows 10.

This screensaver is only a stripped down version of real AARON which Harold Cohen used to make art for his gallery art displays but it still generates wonderful art. Video https://player.vimeo.com/video/16177912

The images it generates can not be saved/exported normally and you can only take a screen shot. It generates image files in temp directory which are only just plain text files with color pallet and brush movment intrstructions.

This viewer can be used to view and save those files.
